2020-06-03 19:47:40	dpfeiffer	can someone help me figure out how to display my shell including its version in a ufetch script?
2020-06-03 19:48:06	MrElendig	distro dependent
2020-06-03 19:48:15	MrElendig	also slightly shell dependent
2020-06-03 19:49:09	dpfeiffer	I am using zsh so $ basename "${SHELL} ${ZSH_ZERSION}" returns with zsh 5.8
2020-06-03 19:49:10	MrElendig	sadly there is no consistent -v/--version/-V behaviour for shells, so you have to code it for each one
2020-06-03 19:49:22	dpfeiffer	sorry, Pop!_OS

2020-06-03 22:41:19	V7	The problem is. There new private and public keys. Server has public one, so it's included into `authorized_keys`. The client has a private key in `.ssh/` folder and `known_hosts` has server's fingerprint. All in all, when connecting to this server it says `load pubkey "<absolutepath>/.ssh/key_private": invalid format`

2020-06-03 22:43:42	hexnewbie	V7: Just assume the key you need is made by both the private and public part, because the private part includes only the private part (i.e. it's really wholly private), therefore you need the other one during the process separately

2020-06-03 22:43:52	prussian	idk git just blindly calls ssh which will pick some default identity and that warning is likely more from ssh-agent trying to handle key encryption for you automagically
