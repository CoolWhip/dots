2020-02-29 20:07:31	dpfeiffer	Hi all. Is there a list of supported fonts for Alacritty? I just tried Victor MOno but doesn't seem to work.

2020-02-29 20:20:54	kchibisov	Could you elaborate on "doesn't seem to work"?
2020-02-29 20:28:14	dpfeiffer	well, I put "Victor Mono in my alacritty.yml and it does not render Victor font, its defaults to some ugly mess
2020-02-29 20:28:42	kchibisov	are you sure that your font is named like that?
2020-02-29 20:29:21	kchibisov	if you're on Linux fc-list | grep -i victor could help
2020-02-29 20:33:45	dpfeiffer	ahh ok, problem solved. on the github page it says to call "Victor Mono" when there should not be a space. "VictorMono" works.
2020-02-29 20:33:46	dpfeiffer	cheer
