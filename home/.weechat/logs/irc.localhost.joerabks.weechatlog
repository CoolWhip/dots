2020-02-01 16:08:54	JoeRabks	Jean is crying a lot now (Purple Crying) but still sleeping at night
2020-02-01 16:09:07	david	Sorry I never replied the other day, got distracted! still woking on my Resume.. will send it to ya when its done for you to proof read if ya dont mind?
2020-02-01 16:09:14	JoeRabks	Week 3-4 very different than week 1-3
2020-02-01 16:09:30	david	ohhh the purple face cry?
2020-02-01 16:09:34	JoeRabks	Yeah no drama, happy to
2020-02-01 16:10:25	JoeRabks	No, I think it's just an acronym the nurse told us about. Common week 4-8, just cry non stop for no reason
2020-02-01 16:10:58	JoeRabks	So that's a bit tough and frustrating, especially when I'm alone with her. But apart from that, all good. She's still just as cute!
2020-02-01 16:11:19	david	ahh yeah, just asked Meegan, she said its a thing.. thats annoying. But with all things, they'll grow out of it..
2020-02-01 16:11:38	JoeRabks	She's more alert for sure, but at the same time not sleeping 23 hours a day... So trade offs
2020-02-01 16:11:49	JoeRabks	Yeah. I'm sure it'll pass
2020-02-01 16:12:01	JoeRabks	How's Olive?
2020-02-01 16:12:29	david	yeah, Olive did it a bit..
2020-02-01 16:13:48	david	we played her happy song alot (Dr Worm) but there is a song that was called the Happy Song by Imogen Heap where she apparently collaborated with scientists to create a soothing and calming song for babies...
2020-02-01 16:15:06	JoeRabks	Yeah I heard of that, I'll check it out. But Jean really likes Johnny Cash
2020-02-01 16:15:21	JoeRabks	I made Greek salad today, it wasn't very good
2020-02-01 16:15:29	JoeRabks	6/10, way soggy
2020-02-01 16:16:06	david	hahaha duude! what happened?
2020-02-01 16:17:54	david	you gotta go easy on the dressing..
2020-02-01 16:18:41	JoeRabks	It wasn't the dressing, I washed the lettuce and don't have the spinny thing
2020-02-01 16:18:59	JoeRabks	I used a collandar but it was still real wet
2020-02-01 16:19:17	JoeRabks	I'm pretty sure that's where I went wrong
2020-02-01 16:23:45	david	yeah, tbh i hardly ever wash my spinach
