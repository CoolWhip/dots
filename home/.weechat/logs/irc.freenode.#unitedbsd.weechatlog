2020-06-03 19:45:49	@js	> <@telegram_698921630:t2bot.io> KASLR? It's come from HBSD and being defaulted on pure FreeBSD since 13-ALPHA
2020-06-03 19:45:49	@js	> NetBSD and OpenBSD too?ðŸ˜„
2020-06-03 19:45:49	@js	OpenBSD has KARL, which is an entirely different thing
2020-06-03 19:47:50	@js	<greywolf "After that, I ended up through v"> A/UX? Amix? Interix? ;)
2020-06-03 19:48:21	@js	<telegram_8551001 "Is it different from kernel aslr"> Yes, a lot. It relinks the kernel in a random order and with random addresses before a reboot.
2020-06-03 20:04:35	telegram_6989216	<js "> <@telegram_698921630:t2bot.io>"> Kernel Address Randomized Link, but HBSD lacks
2020-06-03 20:05:53	@js	KARL is quite annoying on slower machines
2020-06-03 20:06:17	@js	it might be slightly better than KASLR, though, since you also reorder the .o files, so you reorder within a section
2020-06-03 20:06:54	@js	but NetBSD's KASLR comes pretty close, by splitting things into multiple sections and randomizing the address for each, rather than having one large section like most other OSes
2020-06-03 20:07:13	@js	so NetBSD's KASLR is on the same security level as OpenBSD's KARL, but without the abysmal performance
2020-06-03 20:07:45	@js	KARL makes my SPARC64 system unresponsive for minutes after boot
2020-06-03 20:07:54	@js	and if you reboot too quickly, you just lost all your randomization.
2020-06-03 20:08:31	@js	so, if an attacker can try an address and the system reboots because they missed, the attacker gets another chance with the same layout if they were fast enough - NetBSD's KASLR doesn't have that problem
